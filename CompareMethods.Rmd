```

## Aim of analysis

Compare alternative methods of comupting the co-expression matrix:

* MI vs PCC vs SCC
* CLR: z-score vs rank vs nothing

The method shall be applied to the At:Os using all samples but only the 1:1 genes. Further the CCS and ranks shall be calculated, but only the 1:1 ranks and CCS are needed. Method shall be judged by the 1:1 ranks.

## Batch job workflow

* get 1:1 geneIDs
* for At and Os
  * MI, PCC and SCC
* calcScore(M1,M2,CLRmethod=c("z-score","rank","none"))
